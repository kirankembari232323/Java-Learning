//Encapsulation

// Wrapping data nad method into single unit is called
// encapsulation is one of the object oriented principle and it says wrapped the data and method into single unit 
// such that data cannot be accessed by other s and that can only have access through methods

/// encapsulation means don't give direct acess to the data. 
//to creaate encapsulate class we need to create private methods in the class.
// so other class cannot access it directly but they can access it through methods

// encapsulation can controll access of the data

//Access modifiers
// public - ANywhere
// private - accessible within class, can accessthrough methods.
// protected - inheritance class b inherited from class a then b can used prtected method from a
// default - within the package

// if all the variables are private then it is fully encapuslated class. we cannot access it outside the class.
