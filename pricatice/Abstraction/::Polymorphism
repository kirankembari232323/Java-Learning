//Polymorphism

//a process where can sub class can re-defined the behaviour of the parent classs
// ability to take a more than one form

1) method overlloading
2) method overriding - if you want add some extra functionality to parent method and use it into the child class we used overriding
      for example , if you are using calcSalaary() from parent class and we have getBonus() method in child. to get total salry we need to add bonus also
      so we can re-write the calcSalaary() in child class and use getBonus() to get total salary
