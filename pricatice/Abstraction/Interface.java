//Interface

// interface only contains
  

   => Can achieve 100% abstractions
   => abstract method
   => constants
   => only public method
   => cannot be instantiated

  => interfaces can extedns each other

  => There should be exists a class that implements interfaces  and provide implementations of all the abstract methods
  =>if the class fails to provide implementations for one method it must also become abstract
