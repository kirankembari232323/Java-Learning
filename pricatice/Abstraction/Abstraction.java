//Abstraction

// act of representing essantials features & functionalitty and hidning the background details
// focus on what to do not how to do

// Abstraction can be achieve by following two methods
// 1) abastract class
// 2) interface

//Example = ATM - withdrawls

//1) abstract class - 
    
    //- if class contain atleast one abstract method it should be abstract class
    //  abstract class cannot be instatiated - no objec is made from abstract class

//2)Interface

  

   => Can achieve 100% abstractions
   => abstract method
   => constants
   => only public method
   => cannot be instantiated

  => interfaces can extedns each other

  => There should be exists a class that implements interfaces  and provide implementations of all the abstract methods
  =>if the class fails to provide implementations for one method it must also become abstract
